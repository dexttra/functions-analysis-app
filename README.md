## ðŸ“ˆ Desktop application for functional analysis and graph plotting.
### Technical task

#### ðŸŒ€ Project Purpose
A desktop application for exploring functions and plotting their graphs. The user inputs a function equation into a special field. After pressing the "Plot Graph" button, the graph is rendered on the screen.

#### ðŸŒ€ Features
- Plotting the graph of a function.
- Ability to add multiple functions.
- Finding intersection points of the function graph with the Ox and Oy axes.
- Clearing the coordinate plane.
- Ability to save the function graph as an image.

#### ðŸŒ€ Implementation Stages

Version 0.1
- Plotting the graph of a function.

Version 0.2
- Plotting graphs of multiple functions.
- Adding function analysis elements.

Version 0.3
- Ability to save the graph.
